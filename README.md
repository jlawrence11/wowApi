### Basics
There's a lot here and nothing is documented yet. If you're savvy, you can probably figure it out before I add documentation... If not, I'll add it sooner or later.

`cnf/site.example.ini` is an example configuration required for setting up the database and such.

`sql/tables.sql` is the database structure that is used.. you can replace `LW_` with whatever setting you put in the ini.

I am leaving my basic testing source `index.php` in here as it might give a small clue as to how things work and get you started.

You can look in `Core.class` and modify the default region, server, etc there if you'd like. Yes, I am Archnemisis from <Retaliation> on Thrall... defaults are useful for figuring out a toon behind a programmer I suppose.

Anyways, that is all for now.  I add `phpDoc blocks` before I fully update this readme, so auto-generated documentation might help more!
